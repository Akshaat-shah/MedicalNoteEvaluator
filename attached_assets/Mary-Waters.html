1. If there are any medication under "Constipation Risk" please give reason for it: Only "Continue bowel regimen" is included, no medications listed under this heading per rules.
2. If "# Pain Management" section is in final response, then why it is added: Tylenol is active in Orders and mentioned for pain in A&P/Discharge Summary.
3. Explanation about "Wound management": Active skin monitoring orders for multiple sites, so Wound Management section is included with sites and "Cont. wound care."
4. Explanation about "Debility": Diagnosis present in Discharge Summary and NP note, but no active therapy orders with dates, so heading included without therapy lines.
